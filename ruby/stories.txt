Background:

These are my stories and features for module06 (Intro to Cucumber)
from my *QA Automation with Ruby 101* training at:
https://github.com/atodorov/qa-automation-ruby-101/


Idea: I want to build a banking application for Kitties because cute
kitten pictures rule the Internet! My customers will be able to use their
kitty-coins for everything related to cats!


# Story 1 (yellow): A new user can open an account in KittyBank


## Rule (blue):

    Everybody who is a cat owner will receive a bonus

## Example 1 (green):

    Jessica is a cat owner and wants to open account in KittyBank.
    She is allowed to do so and immediately receives a bonus!

## Question (red):

    How much kitty-coins is the bonus?

## Rule (blue):

    Dog owners are not allowed to open accounts

## Example 2 (green):

    Jake owns a dog. When he tries to open an account with KittyBank
    he is not allowed to.

## Question (red):

    How do we even know what kind of animal a person has ?

## Question (red):

    What if the user owns both cat(s) and dog(s)?

## Question (red):

    How about owners of other animals?

## Question (red):

    How about people who don't own animals?



# Story 2 (yellow): account owner can deposit kitty-coins

## Rule (blue):

    Owning 1 cat automatically adds 1 kitty-coin to your account every month

## Example 1 (green):

    Alex owns 3 cats. Every month his balance is increased by 3 kitty-coins.

## Question (red):

    How do we know how many cats the account owner has?

## Question (red):

    What if a cat escapes (or dies) ?

## Rule (blue):

    Physical money can be converted to kitty-coins

## Example 2 (green):

    Alfred wants to deposit 100 BGN into his KittyBank account. These will be
    converted to kitty-coins before being deposited to his account.

## Question (red):

    What is going to be the conversion rate BGN-KTC ?

## Question (red):

    How about conversion rate for other currencies like USD ?

## Question (red):

    Do external factors influence conversion rate for physical money ?


# Story 3 (yellow): account owner can close their account

## Rule (blue):

    This is not possible! Why would anyone want to close their account ?!?

## Example 1 (green):

    Anyone who is an account owner tries to close their account in KittyBank.
    They are denied because once you open an account it can't be closed!


# Story 4 (yellow): kitty-coin owners can spend them for anything related to cats

## Question (red):

    How do you define "anything" ?

## Question (red):

    How do you get 3rd parties to participate in KTC exchange?

## Rule (blue):

    Kitty-coins can be transfered to other account owners

## Example 1 (green):

    Alex owns 100 kitty-coins while Jane has 50. Alex transfers 20 KTC to Jane
    and now he owns 80 while she owns 70!



# Summary

* Story #1 has 5 questions (red) over 2 examples
* Story #2 has 5 questions (red) over 2 examples
* Story #3 has 0 questions over 1 example
* Story #4 has 2 questions unrelated to 1 example

So for the first iteration of our KittyBank application we are going to develop the
following functionality:

- Story #3 - close an account - not possible because this is what boss says
- Story #4 - kitty-coins can be transfered to other account owners. For now we'll
  assume that anyone can open an account!

The `features/` directory contains Gherkin description and Cucumber implementation
of the selected stories.


Then we should seek to answer the existing questions and figure out how to proceed
with development of KittyBank!

Bonus tip: one of the stories selected for implementation is missing specification
for important behavior. What is it!
